# Pizza Menu Web App

This is a simple static web app built with React.js that displays a menu for a restaurant containing six pizzas. Each pizza includes its name, ingredients, and price. If a pizza is sold out, it appears grayed out. The web page also mentions the opening hours of the restaurant. Please note that the order button is not currently responsive.
